 * 
 * This sketch demonstrates the use of the Sparkfun Sound Detector board.
 *
 * The Sound Detector is a small board that combines a microphone and some 
 * processing circuitry.  It provides not only an audio output, but also a 
 * binary indication of the presence of sound and an analog representation 
 * of it's amplitude.  
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates two different modes of usage for the Sound
 * Detector.  The gate output (a binary indication that is high when sound
 * is present, and low when conditions are quiet) is used to fire a pin-change 
 * ISR, which lights an LED when the sound is present.  The envelope output 
 * (an analog voltage to rises to indicate the amplitude of the sound) is 
 * sampled in the loop(), and it prints an indication of the level to the 
 * serial terminal. 
 *
 * For more details about the Sound Detector, please check the hookup guide.
 *
 * Connections:
 * The Sound Detector is connected to the Adrduino as follows:
 * (Sound Detector -> Arduino pin)
 * GND → GND
 * VCC → 5V
 * Gate → Pin 2
 * Envelope → A0
 * 
 * Resources:
 * Additional library requirements: none
 * 
 * Development environment specifics:
 * Using Arduino IDe 1.0.5
 * Tested on Redboard, 3.3v/8MHz and 5v/16MHz ProMini hardware.
 * 
 * This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
 * local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
 * 
 * Distributed as-is; no warranty is given.
